          <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-medium mb-8 font-heading animate-fade-in">Redefining Football Performance</h2>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-xl opacity-90 mb-4 animate-fade-in">At PMxFootball, we’re changing the way football performance is measured and understood.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-xl opacity-90 mb-4 animate-fade-in">Where traditional statistics often stop at goals, possession, or shots on target, our Performance Metric (PM) Index goes further. It tells you not just what happened, but how well it happened.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-xl opacity-90 mb-4 animate-fade-in">The PM Index is built on a carefully designed mathematical model that weighs every key aspect of the game — attacking efficiency, defensive stability, creativity, possession, and overall control. By combining these elements, it produces a single, clear number that reflects the true quality of a team’s performance in any match.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-xl opacity-90 mb-10 animate-fade-in">This matters because PMxFootball is for those who want to go beyond the scoreline and see the game in its full depth. It’s football, understood through numbers — precise, fair, and revealing.</p>

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8 font-heading text-center text-white">Better than xG?</h2>
        <div className="card-grad rounded-2xl p-8 animate-float">
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">Expected Goals (xG) has become one of the most widely used stats in modern football analysis, but it tells only part of the story.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">The PM Index was designed to bridge that gap. By considering a broader set of performance indicators, PM captures the full balance of a team’s display.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">For example, imagine a Champions League knockout match:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li className="text-lg">Team A records an xG of 2.1 but spends most of the game under pressure.</li>
            <li className="text-lg">Team B ends with an xG of only 1.4, yet dominates midfield and defends better.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">xG alone would suggest Team A had the better outing. The PM Index, however, shows that Team B delivered the stronger all-round performance.</p>

        <div className="card-grad rounded-2xl p-8 animate-float">
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">PMxFootball isn’t here to replace the stats you know — it’s here to make them better.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg mb-4">We believe that football deserves a metric that’s as multi-dimensional as the game itself.</p>
          <p className="content-paragraph text-lg">With PM Index, fans, analysts, and even casual followers can finally see beyond the scoreboard and discover who really controlled the game.</p>
